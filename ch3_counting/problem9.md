We are given two sets:

- $$ A = \{x ∈ℝ\mathbb{N} : 4 \leq x < 16\} $$
- $$ B = \{x ∈ℝ\mathbb{N}  : x  \} $$

Let's list the elements explicitly:

-  A = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15} 
-  B = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16,} 

---

## a. Find  A ∩ B 

The intersection of two sets includes all elements that are **common to both** sets.

- Elements in both \( A \) and \( B \):  
  
  A ∩ B = \{4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14\}
  

---

## b. Find  A \ B  

The difference \( A \ B \) includes all elements that are in \( A \) **but not** in \( B \). 

- Elements in \( A \) that are not even:  
   A \ B = \{5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15\}
