## I'm not a real Scientist and thats okay ##

* Steve Wartik’s post, I’m Not a Real Scientist, and That’s Okay, talks about how many people in computer science feel like they don’t belong because they don’t see themselves as “real scientists.” He explains that computer science isn’t just about research—it also includes programming, problem-solving, and practical work. Wartik believes that all of these roles are important and that you don’t have to fit a specific image to make a difference in the field.



* This post was likely assigned to help students understand that computer science is for everyone, not just researchers or theorists. It encourages people to see value in their skills, even if they don’t think of themselves as traditional scientists.



* John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan are famous computer scientists who worked on algorithms and data structures. Hopcroft helped write a well-known book on computer science theory, and Tarjan created important graph algorithms. They won the Turing Award in 1986 for their contributions to the field.
