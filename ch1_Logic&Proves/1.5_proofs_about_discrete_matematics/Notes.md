# Notes
### Injective Functions 
When: $A \to B$   
Where:   
$ A = {1, 2, 3, 4}$   
$ B = {a, b, c, d} $  
 
 B is the image of at most one element in A.
 In other words, no element in B 
 is the **output** for more than one **input** from A.  
  Then:  
  $ f(1) = a, f(2) = b, f(3) = c, f(4) = d. $
