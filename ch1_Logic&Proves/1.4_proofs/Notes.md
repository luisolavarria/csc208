# Notes on Logic Proofs

## Introduction
Logic provides the framework for constructing mathematical proofs. While logic gives structure, mathematical content gives meaning. This chapter explores the importance of both elements in proof construction.

## Logical Structures and Mathematical Content
A proof consists of:
- A logical skeleton: The structure of the argument.
- Mathematical flesh: The actual content and reasoning.

Understanding both components ensures a rigorous and clear proof.

## Examples and Explanation

### Mini Sudoku Proofs
To illustrate the importance of logical structure and mathematical reasoning, the text presents the following example.

| $A$ | $B$ | $A \rightarrow B$ |
| --- | --- | ------------------ |
| $T$ | $T$ | $T$                |
| $T$ | $F$ | $F$                |
| $F$ | $T$ | $T$                |
| $F$ | $F$ | $T$                |


### Understanding Proofs in Different Contexts
Sometimes, familiar facts seem obvious, making their proofs non-trivial. Analyzing problems in different contexts (e.g., Sudoku puzzles) strengthens proof-writing skills.

## Conclusion
Both logic and mathematical reasoning are essential in proof writing. Developing skills in constructing rigorous arguments ensures clarity and correctness in mathematical reasoning.
